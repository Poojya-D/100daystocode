Learan two data structures 
  Array - dynamic array declaration, send an array to function, receive an array, array with pointers
  Linked List - single and double linked list
and learn basic operation in these data structures


Array notes:

- send an array to function
  when we send an array to function and used range bound for loop for below program-

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

string search(int arr[],int num)
{
    for(auto x : arr)
       { if(x == num)
        return "found";
       }
       return "not found";
}
int main()
{
    int arr[] = {3,8,1,7,10,5};
    
    cout<<search(arr,5);

    return 0;
}

Output - I got an error

Reason - we got this error because, when an array is sent to a function , array parameter is adjusted to pointer variable
so when we use auto x - x will of type iterator , so in iterator we need to use begin and end functions to traverse
but as we are thinking x as int variable , we got error.
